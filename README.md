# Constant-Product-Automated-Market-Maker

The Constant-Product Automated Market Maker (CPMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) used in decentralized finance (DeFi).

The CPMM uses a mathematical formula (X * Y = K) that keeps the product of the tokens in a liquidity pool constant, allowing for automated price discovery and trading.

In a CPMM, users can add liquidity to a pool by depositing equal values of two different tokens. They receive liquidity pool tokens in exchange, which represent their share of the pool.

Traders can swap one token for another in a CPMM, with the price determined by the ratio of tokens in the pool.
